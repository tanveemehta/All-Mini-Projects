<h2>What is a paragraph?</h2>

<div>Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. <br>Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. <br>A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116).<br> Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph.<br> For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long.<br> Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support one main idea.<br> In this handout, we will refer to this as the “controlling idea,” because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph.</p>
